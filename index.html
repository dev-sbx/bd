        <h2>HAPPY BIRTHDAY <span>MINDY!!!</span></h2>
        <p>
          Just want you to know; I'm super thankful to have met you. Ive been through so many ups and downs throughout but overall i'm a better person because of it.... you kind of do a lot for me now and I dont' really know what I'd do without you.
          <br><br>

          About age... NM. You already know. Look, Hopefully you don't read this far but man.. this is rly hard to explain but we have this like really weird and unique relationship... i think i appreciate you more than you know and i dont think we can rly be labeled or fit into any categoy. I think you've been through a lot before you met me and you still have a lot of things to overcome. I belive in you and i want you to be healthy happy and fulfilled. <b>happy birthday</b>
